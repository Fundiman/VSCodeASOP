# VSCodeASOP
A Better and improved version of my old port of VSCode for Android (https://www.github.com/Fundiman/VSCodeAndroid).

## History
You probably remember **VSCodeAndroid**, my old repo which was a *VSCode Port for android*! Well I had archived that repo and my source code was accidentatly lost (I had permentatly deleted it by accident) and then I forgot about the project.

## Recently (as of June 21, 2025)
I received a message from a developer asking for the source code of my old project, **VSCodeAndroid** ([https://www.github.com/Fundiman/VSCodeAndroid](https://www.github.com/Fundiman/VSCodeAndroid)). I was initially planning to share it with them, but then I recalled some advice my cousin once gave me: *“Never share your source code with anyone unless it’s already public—because they might steal it and claim it as their own.”* That advice stuck with me, so I decided not to share the code. Instead, I told them I’d be working on a new and improved version of the project.

## Goal Of This Project
- To fix old bugs
- To make the port better
- To make sure this port is compelete and not like the old one
- Listen to other people's suggestions and feedback to improve the project
- Work on this project regularly

That concludes everything I wanted to share. There’s nothing further to add at this point, so we’ve reached the end of the discussion.
